# Hi, I'm Max

Student of Bachelor studies at CTU Uni. I'm really into *theoretical informatics* and like to explore things in it.
I'm particularly passionate about **Programming Language Theory**. 

Right now, I'm studying verification techniques and looking forward to putting my knowledge into practice.

## My PLT projects

### [TinyGo Compiler](https://github.com/Emaisty/Compiler_for_TinyGO)


My current bachelor thesis.
It is a compiler for a simplified version of GoLang.
It preserves all original language features, except for STL(obviously), package manager, and concurrent programming (for future improvements).

In future versions, I would like to extend it with a verification tool, to check for liveness properties and detect data-race.

### [Parser for Pascal-like lang](https://github.com/Emaisty/Mila_parser)

My first PLT project.
Simple parser. Transform source code into a LLVM IR.

### [List evaluator](https://github.com/Emaisty/Lisp_evaluator)

Simple List parser and evaluator.
Parser written in C++. Consists of lexer, parser, and AST. 
AST evaluates the program by itself.

## My other pet-projects

### [Ascii-Img](https://github.com/Emaisty/ASCIIArt_scala)

Img to ascii convertor, writen on Scala.
Takes PNG/JPG images and converts them into ASCII art.

Purely OOP. All parts (Input interface, dispatcher, filters, output, etc.) are logically separated and could be easily extended and covered by tests.

### [Alias](https://github.com/Emaisty/Alias)

GUI-based game, written on Go with the use of [qt](https://github.com/therecipe/qt).

### [Long number library](https://github.com/Emaisty/Longnum)

Library for C++ with the support of long numbers and long arithmetic.
Numbers are represented as an array of booleans.

### [Terminal-based Heartstone game](https://github.com/Emaisty/CardGame)

Simplified Heartstone-like game with terminal-based graphics.
